            Welcome to your dog's home away from home.<br>
            Where we treat your dog as if they are family.
        </h3>
        <p>
            We offer a proven, successful system combined with higher values and<br>
            standards for pet care. K-Nine to Five &trade; is committed to the health and<br>
            happiness of Calumet's best friends. Much more than a unique alternative to<br>
            doggy daycare, we offer full service boarding, daycare and playroom that<br>
            stimulates dogs mentally and physically - all in a safe environment where<br>
            they can play and socialize.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our spa, guests are pampered, entertained, and indulged with meticulous<br>
            care and personal attention. Every aspect of attending to our guests'<br>
            uniquely discerning and sometimes exuberant tastes is perfectly<br>
            orchestrated to assure happy and satisfied guests, no matter how long or<br>
            short the stay. It is with exceptional pride that we offer sumptuous<br>
            accommodations, lavish amenities, and an unparalleled five star resort<br>
            beyond imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your peace of mind is important to us.
            We know what it takes to make this<br>
            business work and the positive word of mouth has made our business a<br>
            booming success.
